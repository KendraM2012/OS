To run studentThreadA:
  gcc -o studentThreadA studentThreadA.c -lpthread -lm
  ./studentThreadA

To run studentThreadB:
  gcc -o studentThreadB studentThreadB.c -lpthread -lm
  ./studentThreadB

  Note: it can take studentThreadA a while to not total to $4000
  It look me like 15 times on the linux server and 3 time on my windows
  ubuntu.
